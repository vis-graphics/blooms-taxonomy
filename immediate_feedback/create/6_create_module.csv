CIF,Link to uploaded file omitted,"Chart's title is missing and there is no option to add it. Discrete colour schema has only 10 colours, I'd like to add much more. left and right margins were too small to see all the data. I liked that axes names and measurements were added automatically.","golden crisp, smacks",All-Bran with Extra Fiber,"K, G",Cap'n'Crunch,Golden Grahams,Link to uploaded file omitted,"names of cereals were not visible on the left, would be nice to see full names  there and names were not selectable, copyable from the table, it is not convenient. Would be nice to add option double-click on the name and  it all highlights and can be copied to the buffer and pasted later on into the google form or whatever else. Filtering on one axis is not always clear and sometimes it didn't show all data after it was lifted, would be nice to make it more user friendly by adding removing options like 'clear filtering of x axis', 'clear all filtering'. Export works ok, but it cuts names of the first axis, I didn't find a way to add margins. Dragging axis option and axis measurement reordering by double click work great! Also I'd like to add scaling to the functionality and colouring to the chart."
