CIF,Module 1,Module 3,6,
CIF,Module 1 was the easiest because it was such a simple task (recognition),"I found Module 3 difficult just because of the amount of frustration fiddling with Google slides that wanted to snap lines someplace other than where I want them to go.  I should have used pen and paper.   

Module 5 was more challenging conceptually (some faults were difficult to spot, and at first I wasn't quite sure of the distinction between the different names of labels), but was vastly less frustrating.",6,"Re-evaluate the time estimations for the tasks - the apply (create the plots in Google slides) took much longer than 10 minutes.  Also, if there are any alternatives to Google slides that allows for easier, less fussy drawing, that might make the process faster and less frustrating (conceptually it wasn't hard, but the tool made it difficult) "
CIF,"Module6, I found this the easiest because I realized what we were trying to do introducing the parallel coordinate plots","Module4, there were certain questions where it tells you that you have selected the wrong answer and I didn't find it 100% helpful",6,
CIF,"Module 1: Recognition (recognizing what is and isn't a parallel coordinates chart)
Module 2: Understand (learning about the various components of the parallel coordinates chart)

They are the easiest because I just have to sit back and watch the video and try learn the concepts  by watching the video, I don't actually have to apply the knowledge and do it my self. For the other moduels, you really have to start from sratch and apply the knowledge you just learned a couple of minutes ago.","Apply is the most difficult, because you have to apply your knolwedge and really do the work your self. ",7,"Make it shorter! I feel like I was gonna quit towards the end. I spent almost 3 hours doing this. But you know, I push it through because I feel like it's gonna be a great help to my Professor Alark. So I did put my best effort into this survey."
CIF,Recognition was the easiest since I have experience with different data visualization techniques prior to this survey.,Module 3 was the hardest. Drawing on slides was too tiresome.,7,
CIF,"I found that, Module 4: Analyze (examining charts to learn something about the data), was the best Module to study because you are looking at various charts and determining the flaws behind the chart allowing you to get more knowledge of the various different parallel coordinate charts out there. ","I found that, Module 3: Apply (drawing the charts using pen and paper / Google Slides), was the most difficult module for me because, personally, I am not good at drawing charts but also because it took the most time within this research study. Majority of the modules were more efficient. ",6,This Project was great. Maybe having a less amount of modules due to the fact that it took a long time to complete. 
CIF,I found Module 1 to be the easiest since the characteristics of parallel coordinates is very distinct and learning to recognize them was really easy.,Module 3: apply was the most difficult since data labels and figuring out the correct part of the axis for a line to pass through was more difficult and I felt like errors while inputting would be more apparent. ,7,I think the module on Analysing and finding errors in charts was a bit too long and repetitive
CIF,Module 1,Module 6 and 6,4,This is too long. Loss retention in the end.
CIF,Recognition,Evaluate/Critique ,4,
CIF,I think create module is easiest because we can use tools,"evaluate, too many questions and easy to get lost",6,
CIF,,,6,
CIF,"6, because its really easy to fetch the data ","3, I find it super difficult to draw the graph without using other tool or website. ",7,
CIF,Module 6 because I don't like to draw this by hand,Module 3: It's time consuming to draw this with hand as it's hard to scale correctly,5,The csv link to download is not easy to see how to download the file. I had to copy and paste into excel to generate csv file.
CIF,"All of the modules were not complicated, one with creating own chart in presentation was time consuming I would do it much faster on paper, but I haven't guessed it at the beginning. The last module was fun and the most easiest after all explanations and practice from all previous modules.",I'd point Evaluate/Critique module mostly because there were some charts' options that I didn't understand at first and some of them I wasn't sure which answer to choose even though I got the meaning of each of them.,6,"Would be nice to find another tool for creating own chart as it was quite time consuming to add all the labels and colour agenda, maybe some online graphic editor?"
NF,6,2,3,
NF,module1,5,2,
NF,5 since I was able to just upload the data and explore the data with the website.,3. I dont think my drawing was very good and it took awhile for me to draw it.,3,
NF,1 2,6,4,
NF,survey too long but still interesting,4,5,make it short next time
NF,Module 2 is the easiest. Reading the completed parallel graph identifying all the information inside the graph is the easiest for me.,Module 5 is the hardest for me. I feel like some of the graph is too similar and most of the time I couldn't identify what's wrong with the graph,5,
NF,"Module 1 - It was the easiest because it covered the basic concept and also didn't require additional tasks such as surveys and uploading data to a separate websites, etc. 
","Modules 4,5,6 - leaving the survey and go to another survey then create parallel charts using additional tools online was very confusing. I was afraid whether I might accidentally close the tab for the main survey and all my works would be lost.",7,"It took me two full hours to go through all modules in one sitting. One reason for that is because I am a slow reader and another is that I am not aware whether I could save my progress somehow (did not see a such button) and couldn't take a break.
While the whole survey was interesting and I learned a lot, I wouldn't say it was enjoyable and unsure whether I would recommend others to participate."
NF,Recognition and understanding. Easier on the eye,Creating them was hard because the option wasnt even there. bad ui,6,too many similar types of charts
NF,Module 1 because it was the least amount of work,"Module 3, the data was not much but it took some time to create the graph",6,
NF,"mod1
the characteristics is obvious ","mod3
very difficult to generate",5,
NF,"easiest would be recognition as the video helps clarify and explains its differences, and helps determine the other charts compared to it",apply because it took me awhile to use google slides to create a coordinate plot graph,6,the survey has been fine
NF,Module 1,Module 3,4,
